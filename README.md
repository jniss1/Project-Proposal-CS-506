# Project-Proposal-CS-506

The project proposal should include the following:

Description of the project.
- Clear goal(s) (e.g. Successfully predict the number of students attending lecture based on the weather report).


  
- What data needs to be collected and how you will collect it (e.g. scraping xyz website or polling students).


  
- How you plan on modeling the data (e.g. clustering, fitting a linear model, decision trees, XGBoost, some sort of deep learning method, etc.).



- How do you plan on visualizing the data? (e.g. interactive t-SNE plot, scatter plot of feature x vs. feature y).


  
- What is your test plan? (e.g. withhold 20% of data for testing, train on data collected in October and test on data collected in November, etc.).



Note that at this stage of the project you should be as explicit as possible on what the goals of the project are and how you plan on collecting the data. You can be a little more vague on the modeling and visualization aspects because that will evolve as you learn more methods in class and see what the data looks like.


Keep in mind that the scope of this project should reflect two months worth of work. Do not be overly simple or ambitious. The course staff will provide feedback on your proposal.
